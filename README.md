# eigenwallet

This is the monorepo containing the source code for all of our core projects:

- [`swap`](swap/README.md) contains the source code for the main swapping binaries, `asb` and `swap`
  - [`maker`](dev-docs/asb/README.md)
  - [`taker`](dev-docs/cli/README.md)
- [`gui`](src-gui/README.md) contains the new tauri based user interface
- [`tauri`](src-tauri/) contains the tauri bindings between binaries and user interface
- and other crates we use in our binaries

If you're just here for the software, head over to the [releases](https://github.com/eigenwallet/xmr-btc-swap/releases/latest) tab and grab the binary for your operating system! If you're just looking for documentation, check out our [docs page](https://docs.unstoppableswap.net/) or our [github docs](dev-docs/README.md).

Join our [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#unstoppableswap-core:matrix.org) to follow development more closely.

> The project was previously known as UnstoppableSwap. Read [this](https://eigenwallet.org/rename.html) for our motivation for the rename.
