# XMR<>BTC Atomic Swap - User Interface Prototype Validation

This document sums up the questions that we would like to validated with 

## Questions

With the UI prototypes we are trying to answer the following questions.
The questions are split between maker and taker, because the objectives are somewhat different.

Is a `taker` happy to...

1. run a bitcoind full-node
1. run a monerod full-node
1. use a webpage for discovering makers
1. use a privacy chat tool for discovering makers
1. manually add makers to retrieve orders
1. download software (swap execution daemon) before being able to do a swap
1. run the swap daemon locally on the taker's machine
1. keep the swap daemon running for the whole length of the swap execution
1. give control over the bitcoin and monero wallet to the swap execution daemon
1. keep the browser open for the whole length of the swap execution
1. be in different cryptographic roles depending on the direction of the swap
1. run the swap execution daemon without using Tor
1. connect to a maker that does not use Tor

... to do an XMR<>BTC swap?

1. set up a webpage where takers get a price 
1. publicly advertise being a maker
