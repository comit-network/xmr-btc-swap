# How to complete your first Atomic Swap

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of completing your first atomic swap using the UnstoppableSwap GUI.
Although the process is quite intuitive, there are some nuances to be aware of, so we'll cover everything you need to know to get started.

## Prerequisites

To complete an Atomic Swap, you'll need to have the following:

1. A Monero wallet you can use to receive funds
2. A Bitcoin wallet you can use with some funds in it. 
This wallet should also be able to generate a native SegWit address (an address starting with `bc1`). 
This address will also receive any refunded Bitcoin if the swap is not completed.
3. _UnstoppableSwap GUI_ installed on your computer. 
We'll refer to this as _GUI_ from now on. View the [installation instructions](../getting_started/install_instructions) if you haven't already installed the GUI.

## Performing the swap
<Steps>
### Choose a _Swap Provider_ to swap with

After opening the GUI, you'll be greeted with the main screen. 
In the bottom of the screen you can see the currently selected _Swap Provider_. 
This is who you'll send your Bitcoin to and who you'll receive the Monero from. 
You can change the _Swap Provider_ by clicking on the arrow and selecting a different _Swap Provider_ from the list.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info">
Different _Swap Providers_ offer different exchange rates and differing amounts of liquidity. You may want to choose the _Swap Provider_ that best suits your needs.
</Callout>

You can also use input field to calculate the approximate amount of Monero you'll receive for a given amount of Bitcoin. 

<Callout type="info">
The actual swap amount will be determined when you deposit your Bitcoin. 
This is only used as a reference for you to get a rough idea of how much Monero you'll receive for your Bitcoin.
</Callout>

### Start the Swap

Once you've selected a _Swap Provider_, you can start the swap by clicking the `Swap` button. 
This will open a new window where you need to enter two addresses:

1. the Monero address you want to receive the Monero to
2. the Bitcoin address where you want to receive the Bitcoin refund incase the swap is not completed successfully.

### Depositing Bitcoin

After pressing the <img src="/start_swap_button.png" style={{
    height: "1lh",
    display: "inline-block",
    // center vertically
    verticalAlign: "middle",
}}/> button, you'll be shown an offer by the _Swap Provider_. This includes:

- the exchange rate (how much Bitcoin they demand for 1 Monero)
- the minimum and maximum amounts you can swap
- the network fees that'll be spent on the Bitcoin lock transaction

<Callout type="info">
You can hover over these values to see their value in `USD`.
</Callout>

If you're happy with the offer, you can proceed by sending the Bitcoin to the address displayed on the screen.
All funds sent to this address will be used for the swap as long as they below the maximum amount.

<Callout type="info">
This is where the actual swap amount is determined.
Be careful to send only as much Bitcoin as you want to swap.
</Callout>

### Waiting for the swap to complete

After sending the Bitcoin, you'll need to wait a moment for the Bitcoin to be locked.
After the lock transaction has been confirmed, the other party will lock the Monero funds.
In most cases, it will take around 10 minutes for the Bitcoin lock transaction to be confirmed and 2 minutes later the Monero lock transaction will be confirmed.

The swap will go through four stages:

1. **Locking the Bitcoin**:
Your Bitcoin is locked in a 2-of-2 multisig address.

2. **_Swap Provider_ locks the Monero**:
The other party locks their Monero as well.

3. **_Swap Provider_ redeems _Bitcoin_**:
The other party redeems the Bitcoin.

4. **Redeeming the Monero**:
You redeem the Monero using a key that was revealed in step 3.
